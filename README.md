# Tetris24h
<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p>
To build a mostly fully featured tetris game in 24 hours of work. This work will be spread out through 3 days lasting no more than 24 hours.<br>
The project will be timed with a modern clock.<br>
The project must be built from scratch with no additional SDKs or APIs. The exception to this rule is the Windows API since it is required to create a window and access audio. The C++ standard library makes calls to the OS for certain functions so avoiding the Windows API would be impossible. Anything that can be done without the Windows API such as rendering must be done from scratch.
